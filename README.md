# DrinkBeer Refill
This is an unofficial fork of **Drink Beer forge** mod, 
providing full fabric-3.0.2 version features in 1.19.2+ forge version and built-in JEI/Jade support, as well as other new features.

## Why refill?
Reasons are simple: 
* New ways to interact (e.g. Place Beer in Bartending Table and see it)
* (Partial) Automation support by implementing Capability (e.g. Hopper supports Bartending Table)
